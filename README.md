# Pandas Weather Analysis

This repository contains a Python script, used to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. To accomplish this, I used(https://pypi.python.org/pypi/citipy) and the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api).

Using these libraries I have created the 4 four following scatter plots to display relationships between Latitude and the other 4 causal variables.

* Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
* Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
* Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
* Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude
